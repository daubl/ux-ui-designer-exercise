    <!-- PAGE CONTENT -->
    <div class="container mt-1">
      Here is a list of the usability issues that have been resolved in <a href="../pages/variant-b.html">version B</a>: 

      <h6 class="mt-3 text-primary">TABS</h6>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">The active tab isn't visible enough. If someone has poor eyesight or a bad screen, the difference between the active tab and a normal tab isn't very obvious.</li>
        <li  class="list-item">For the tab whose content is a loader, it's a shame that you have to click on it to see it, when all you have to do is add a loader to the tab to realise that the tab's content is not yet available.</li>
        <li  class="list-item">For the disable tab, it's always good to indicate why an element isn't accessible (by adding a tooltip for example) - Not yet implemented</li>
      </ul>

      <h6 class="mt-4  text-primary">TITLES</h6>
      The difference in hierarchy between the 2 titles is not obvious, so I've emphasised it in my version.

      <h6 class="mt-4  text-primary">CONTENT</h6>
      It's not clear which item in the list the image is associated with.

      <h5 class="mt-5 text-primary">UI</h5>
      I preferred to remove the background colours of the header and footer because it gave too much of an impression that the content was crushed.
      I've added small image icons for the items in the list, thinking of other use cases like, for example, if one of the images had been a video it would have been indicated by a play icon.
